## Hand-by-hand guidance for prepare dataset

### ScanNet V2
- Download the ScanNet V2 dataset and go to its dir, which has the following files
```bash
scannetv2-labels.combined.tsv # label for train and val set
scans                         # scans for train and val set
scans_test                    # scans for test set
tasks
```
- Preprocess the train and val files as follows
```bash
python -u scannet/preprocess_scannet.py \
  --input PATH_TO_YOUR_SCANNETV2/scans \
  --output SOME_PATH/scannet_fully_supervised_preprocessed \
  --splits train # train includes both train & val
```
- Copy the split files to your preprocessed dir
```bash
cp -r scannet/splits SOME_PATH/scannet_fully_supervised_preprocessed/
```
- Generate the label ids, which are used to provide the ``weak (sparse) labels``
- Two types of sparse labels:
  - Absolute points: 20,50,100,200 points from [Official ScanNet Data Efficient Benchmark](https://kaldir.vc.in.tum.de/scannet_benchmark/data_efficient/documentation)
  - Percentage points: 0.01%, 0.1% generated by our script (:fire: the script will be released later)
```
cp -r scannet/points SOME_PATH/scannet_fully_supervised_preprocessed/
```
